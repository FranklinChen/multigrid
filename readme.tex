\section{Equation}
\label{sec:equation}

I used the \emph{Poisson} equation in 2d:
\begin{displaymath}
  \nabla^2\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{f}
\end{displaymath}

This was suggested in the assignment, and was also discussed in
Briggs.


\subsection{Source}
\label{sec:source}

I tried some sample $\mathbf{f}$ for the equation.  One was
$\mathbf{f} = \mathbf{0}$ (Laplace).  I settled on another constant,
just for the heck of it.

I did not provide a user interface for plugging in various f, though
that would be easy, e.g., parse some stream of numbers from a file.


\subsection{Boundary values}
\label{sec:boundary-values}

The \emph{Dirichlet boundary values} I chose were to take the 2d unit
square as the boundaries, and have all sides be $0$ except a portion
of sine wave on one side, in order to get a simple but not completely
trivial solution surface.

\section{Implementation language}
\label{sec:language}

I implemented everything in \emph{Objective Caml} (O'Caml), a dialect
of ML.  I hadn't done much with this dialect, but figured now was as
good a time as any to experiment with it, instead of using
\emph{Standard ML}.

Since O'Caml supports arrays of unboxed floating point numbers, this
gave a fighting chance of not being too inefficient, though I suspect
that I could write C or C++ code that does significantly better.

Because I lacked time, I did not experiment with using a language with
high level support of arrays, such as ZPL, SAC, or FiSH.  I am
interested in trying this at some point.

Note: I use arrays of arrays for matrices.  This obviously misses out
on the memory locality and opportunities for good caching and loop
unrolling possible when using a block of contiguous memory as a
matrix (as the \texttt{svl} library in C++ attempts to do, as does the
SML/NJ library for Standard ML).

My first implementation was written purely functionally, with no side
effects in the computation, e.g., arrays were never modified.  I
reimplemented it to use mutation, and the speedup wasn't all that
large, actually.  I stuck to the mutative version though.

My primary source of equations was Briggs.  I also looked at
\emph{Numerical Recipes in C} earlier, did not consult it while in the
process of writing my own, since I first wrote all my code purely
functionally, then converted it in steps to use mutation.

\section{Platform}
\label{sec:platform}

I developed my program on my home PC, a Pentium 200 with 32 MB RAM
running Red Hat Linux 5.1.  I did some runs on my office PC, a Pentium
II 400 with 128 MB RAM, and performance appeared to be around four
times greater.

\section{Algorithms}

\subsection{Relaxation}
\label{sec:relaxation}

I implemented both \emph{Gauss-Seidel} (red-black) and \emph{Jacobi},
both of them with optional weighting ($\omega$) for overrelaxation.

I made no effort to make these crucial steps fast.  A lot of
interesting cache-related optimizations could be performed, but I
could only do that if I were using something as low level as C.


\subsection{Interpolation}
\label{sec:interpolation}

I used 2d linear interpolation, as suggested by Briggs.


\subsection{Restriction}

I used full-weighted 2d restriction, as suggested by Briggs.


\subsection{Multigrid}

I implemented the $\mu$-cycle generalization of the V-cycle, with fixed
numbers of iterations, specified for the duration of a run from the
command line.


\clearpage
\section{Command line arguments}
\label{sec:command-line}

Many parameters can be set for the duration of a run by means of
command line arguments.

\input{command.tex}

\section{Timing, accuracy, speed}
\label{sec:timing}

Roughly, I was able to get full multigrid running to the desired
accuracy suggested (relative residual $< 10^{-6}$) on a $256 \times 256$
grid in about $9$ seconds on my home PC, and about $2$ seconds on my
office PC.

Attempts to get fine-grained data for algorithms other than full
multigrid were not very successful, because for larger $n$ things
would take forever, and furthermore, not achieve good accuracy.

I generated a bunch of runs by trying to guess parameters.  I tried to
be more scientific by adding code to detect when the relative residual
was small enough, but this expensive computation slowed things down
significantly.  I didn't try to just periodically do the check
instead.

\subsection{Plot}
\label{sec:plot}

In Figure \ref{all three}, we show the results for
\begin{itemize}
\item Weighted red-black Gauss-Seidel, 1300 iterations (note last two
  grid sizes did not complete in a reasonable time).
\item $\mu$-cycle, actually just a V-cycle, with 500 iterations pre and
  post.
\item Full multigrid, with parameters 4, 2, 2.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Picture}
\label{sec:picture}

I didn't have time to do anything fancy with graphics, an area I don't
really know much about (but wish to).  My program will generate a
simplistic VRML file, however, treating the solution field as an
\texttt{ElevationGrid}.  An example is in \texttt{dataset.data} (see
\texttt{Makefile} for options used).
